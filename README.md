# ScoreboardRevision

Disclaimer: Scoreboard-r is a RienBijl's rewrite of their original Scoreboard plugin.
ScoreboardRevision is just a fork of that effort.

## What is this all about?

ScoreboardRevision is a powerful way to make animated Scoreboards for the Spigot API.
It leverages special techniques to achieve a no-flicker board that looks smooth to your players.
It is very lightweight and fast due to its asynchronous design.
